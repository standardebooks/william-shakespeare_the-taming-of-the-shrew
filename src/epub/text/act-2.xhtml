									<span>Well, gentlemen,</span>
									<br/>
									<span>I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know</span>
									<br/>
									<span>My daughter Katharina is to be married:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca</span>
									<br/>
									<span>Be bride to you, if you this assurance;</span>
									<br/>
									<span>If not, Signior Gremio:</span>
									<br/>
									<span>And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.</span>
